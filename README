Matrix-vector multiplication server using PETSc. Useful for carrying out 
matrix-vector multiplications in parallel inside of Octave or Matlab 
using large matrices.

====== petsc installation ========

PETSc (http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/) must be installed and correctly 
sourced prior to use.

basic installation (assume 64 indices for large matrix support)

mkdir /opt/petsc_software/

wget and untar petsc-3.5.1.tar.gz (or latest version)
cd petsc-3.5.1/

./configure --with-cc=gcc --with-cxx=g++ --with-fc=0 --download-f2cblaslapack --download-mpich --with-64-bit-indices

make PETSC_DIR=/opt/petsc_software/petsc-3.5.1 PETSC_ARCH=arch-linux2-c-debug all

make PETSC_DIR=/opt/petsc_software/petsc-3.5.1 PETSC_ARCH=arch-linux2-c-debug test

====== code compilation ========

run the script compile_all.sh

this compiles the c code in server_code/ and client_code/ folders

gcc -o get_petsc_vector_length get_petsc_vector_length.c
make petsc_server_regular


====== usage ========

The server must be launched, this maybe done using the supplied start_server script:

./start_server.sh

Then in another tab or terminal, open octave or matlab and execute

compute_Ax_and_Atx.m
